### A new desk inspired by Orison Scott Card's book: 'Enders Game'.

It should allow a teacher to:
* send questions to an entire class simultaneously
* get instant feedback on the class' performance
* track the progress of individual students
* identify types of problems a particular student is struggling with

It should allow a student to:
* answer in-class questions anonymously and without peer-pressure
* be evaluated without spending excessive time in a testing environment
